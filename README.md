# CPong
The famous game "Pong" written with Gtk+ and OpenGL.

## How to play
You can get precompiled version of this program [here]().

## Compile
### CHECK DEPENDECIES BEFORE COMPILE.
I provided a simple 'compile' file for _Linux_. For _Windows 10_ and _macOS_ should be the same command. 
Anyway, the file is _executable_, so, if you are on Linux, you can type:
```bash
cd src
./compile
```

## Dependecies
If you want to download and work by yourself, you need some stuff.
Here a list of dependecies for O.S.:

- **Windows**
  - [Gtk+3.0](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows/) or newer & OpenGL
    - Driver OpenGL for [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
    - Driver OpenGL for [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
    - Driver OpenGL for [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)
- **Linux**
  - [Gtk+3.0](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/) or newer & OpenGL
    - Driver OpenGL for [AMD](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/linux)
    - Driver OpenGL for [Intel](https://01.org/linuxgraphics)
    - Driver OpenGL for [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html)

For **macOS** users, you don't need to download anything, because OpenGL is include in the system.

All these informations come from [khronos.org](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started), so if you want more information visit this site.
